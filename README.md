The rapid growth of digital services has significantly transformed the food industry, making online 
food ordering platforms an essential part of modern lifestyles. This project presents the design and 
development of a full-stack food delivery web application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, 
Express.js, React, Node.js). 
The system enables users to browse a variety of food items, add them to a cart, place secure online 
orders, and track their status in real-time. It incorporates key modules such as user authentication, order 
management, and payment integration, along with an intuitive user interface. On the backend, RESTful 
APIs handle data flow between users, food items, orders, and the database, while the frontend ensures 
seamless interaction and responsive design. 
The proposed system enhances convenience, reduces manual errors, and bridges the gap between 
restaurants and customers by providing a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly platform for online food 
ordering.
